  <p>
    At <strong>TempMail Pro</strong>, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how our temporary email service operates, what information is (and is not) collected, and how third-party services are involved.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    TempMail Pro does not require user registration and does not intentionally collect personally identifiable information such as names, permanent email addresses, phone numbers, or account credentials.
  </p>

  <h2>Temporary Email Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Temporary email addresses generated on TempMail Pro are intended for short-term use. Incoming messages are handled through a secure third-party email infrastructure and are accessible only during the active session. Messages may be automatically deleted by the external email provider after a limited period.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Our service relies on external APIs (such as Mail.tm) to provide temporary email functionality. These third-party providers process email messages according to their own privacy policies and terms. TempMail Pro does not control or permanently store email content processed by these services.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
  <p>
    TempMail Pro may use essential cookies or browser storage technologies to support core functionality, such as session handling, inbox refresh, and user interface preferences. These technologies do not track users across websites and are not used for advertising profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable technical measures to ensure that interactions with our website remain secure. However, as this service is designed for temporary and anonymous use, users are encouraged not to send or receive sensitive personal information through disposable email addresses.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Information</h2>
  <p>
    TempMail Pro is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legal requirements, or service functionality. Any updates will be posted on this page.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using TempMail Pro, you agree to this Privacy Policy and understand the temporary and anonymous nature of the service.
  </p>
