    <p>At TempMail Pro, we take your privacy seriously. Our service is built around the core principle of providing a temporary, anonymous email experience without collecting or storing any personal information. We do not require any registration, login, or identity verification to use our disposable email service — meaning your privacy is preserved by default.

When you use TempMail Pro, all email generation and inbox handling is powered by a secure third-party API (Mail.tm), which temporarily stores your incoming messages. We do not have access to your personal inbox, nor do we retain any messages, IP addresses, cookies, or usage logs. Your anonymous email sessions exist only in your browser and are automatically discarded when closed or refreshed.

We do not use trackers or sell data to advertisers. The only data temporarily used is session-level email tokens, which allow your browser to view inbox messages — and even that data is encrypted and never stored by us. Our entire platform is designed to offer maximum spam protection, data minimalism, and online anonymity for users across the world.

This website may use essential cookies to deliver core functionality such as inbox refresh, modal popups, and theme settings. These cookies do not track you or link any information to identifiable users. By using our site, you agree to this privacy policy and the fundamental goal of offering free, anonymous email addresses that protect you from spam, scams, and digital clutter.</p>
    <p>All messages are handled securely through the external API, and no personal information is stored by us.</p>
    <p>We use basic cookies only for functionality. By using this site, you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
