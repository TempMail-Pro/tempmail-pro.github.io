   <h2>What is TempMail Pro?</h2>
<p>TempMail Pro is a free, fast, and secure <strong>temporary email generator</strong> that provides users with disposable, anonymous email addresses. It's perfect for signups, free trials, OTP verification, newsletters, app testing, and any situation where you don’t want to use your real email address.</p>
<h2>Is TempMail Pro really anonymous?</h2>
<p>Yes. You don’t need to register, login, or share any personal information to use TempMail Pro. Your email is created on the fly and can be used instantly, giving you a 100% <strong>anonymous email experience</strong> without leaving a digital trace.</p>
<h2>How long does a temporary email address last?</h2>
<p>Each email address is stored temporarily and linked to your browser session. If you close or refresh the page, your inbox may reset. For longer use, leave the tab open or copy the address before closing. Emails are automatically deleted after a short period for privacy and performance reasons.</p>
<h2>Can I use TempMail Pro to receive OTPs or verification codes?</h2>
<p>Yes! TempMail Pro is commonly used to receive <strong>OTP emails</strong> and verification codes from websites, apps, or services that require email confirmation. It's the best choice when you want quick access without spam or sign-up.</p>
<h2>Can I send emails from my temporary address?</h2>
<p>No. TempMail Pro is a **receive-only email service**. It does not support sending, replying to, or forwarding messages. It's built solely for receiving one-time emails, verification links, and newsletters safely and privately.</p>
<h2>Is TempMail Pro safe to use?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Our system is built using the secure and trusted <strong>Mail.tm API</strong>, and no personal data is collected. TempMail Pro ensures your privacy is protected and your real inbox stays clean and spam-free.</p>
<h2>Will using temp mail get me banned from websites?</h2>
<p>Some platforms may block disposable email addresses to prevent abuse, but many still accept them for signups and OTPs. TempMail Pro is ideal for accessing gated content, testing apps, or signing up for services that don’t require a permanent email address.</p>
<h2>Is TempMail Pro free forever?</h2>
<p>Yes. TempMail Pro is 100% free with no subscriptions or paywalls. You can use it anytime, from any device, to create anonymous and disposable email addresses instantly.</p>
<h2>Can I use TempMail Pro on mobile devices?</h2>
<p>Yes! TempMail Pro is fully responsive and works great on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. The interface adjusts automatically, allowing you to generate and check disposable emails on the go.</p>
<h2>Why should I use a disposable email address?</h2>
<p>Using a <strong>temporary email address</strong> protects your main inbox from spam, phishing, and promotional clutter. It also prevents unwanted tracking and preserves your online privacy, especially when registering for untrusted websites or apps.</p>
