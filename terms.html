    <p>By accessing and using TempMail Pro, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions. TempMail Pro is a free disposable email service that allows users to receive emails anonymously and without registration. The service is provided "as is" and is intended solely for legal, ethical, and privacy-conscious usage.

You are strictly prohibited from using TempMail Pro for any activity that violates the law, including but not limited to phishing, spamming, spreading malware, scamming, or impersonating others. If we detect abuse of our service or malicious behavior originating from any IP, device, or browser session, we reserve the right to restrict or block access permanently.

All email addresses generated via TempMail Pro are temporary, non-exclusive, and public by nature. Anyone who knows your temporary email address can potentially view incoming messages. We recommend using TempMail Pro only for short-term activities such as receiving OTP emails, verification codes, or signing up for spam-prone websites.

While we strive to offer continuous service, we cannot guarantee uptime, message delivery, or message permanence. Emails may be deleted automatically after a short time. TempMail Pro is not responsible for any data loss, misuse, or failure of service. By continuing to use this website, you accept that this is a free, anonymous tool with no liability for outcomes beyond our control.</p>
    <p>You must not use TempMail Pro for spamming, phishing, harassment, or any activity that violates applicable laws.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to restrict access or ban users at our discretion in case of misuse.</p>
